# Quantathon-2025---TEAM-4
Quantum-AI Traffic Optimization 
Traffic congestion is a critical and costly challenge across many African cities, impacting economic productivity, quality of life, and environmental sustainability.  The project demonstrates the use of quantum-classical hybrid algorithms (primarily QAOA) to optimize traffic congestion and green-light timings using quantum approach.

## Next Steps
### Please add after each title your ideas and/or suggestions and DO NOT FORGET TO COMMIT CHANGES (green button top right)

1. Problem dee dive/refine idea
   
3. Look for available traffic /geospatial data - both simulated and real
   
5. Create a work plan and assign responsabilities - nest meeting



## Datasets:
1- From kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/traffic-prediction-dataset?resource=download
      traffic.csv

2- From UTD19 under the following Terms and Conditions: 
      The data will be used only for academic and/or non-commercial purposes.
      For any publication that utilizes the UTD19 dataset, authors should include a reference to https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51539-5.
      Include the data source as UTD19 (utd19.ethz.ch) in the acknowledgment section of your publication.

      These are the datasets titled: manual.pdf, links.csv, detectors_public.csv, utd_19_u.csv
   
## Usage
