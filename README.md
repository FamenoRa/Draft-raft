# Quantathon-2025---TEAM-4
Quantum-AI Traffic Optimization 
Traffic congestion is a critical and costly challenge across many African cities, impacting economic productivity, quality of life, and environmental sustainability.  The project demonstrates the use of quantum-classical hybrid algorithms (primarily QAOA) to optimize traffic congestion and green-light timings using quantum approach.
